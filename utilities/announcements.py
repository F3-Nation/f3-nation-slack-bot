"to new members as they join your Slack space. This is a great way to introduce new members to your region and let them"
"know how to navigate your space. Use `/config-welcome-message` to set it up.\n\n"
msg += ":runner: *Strava Integration!* - Allows Strava PAX to transfer the backblast notes over to Strava, while "
"gathering workout data (calories, distance) from linked devices. Go to `/config-slackblast` to enable.\n\n"
msg += ":bar_chart: *Custom Fields!* - Does your region want to track something specific in your backblasts (burpee "
"count, gloom index, etc.)? You can create your own fields through the Custom Field menu in `/config-slackblast`.\n\n"
msg += ":sports_medal: *Weaselbot Achievements (new today)!* - For those using <https://github.com/F3Nation-Community"
"/weaselbot|Weaselbot>, you can now assign achievements to PAX directly without having to create a whole backblast "
"for it. Use the `/tag-achievement` command to get started.\n\n"
